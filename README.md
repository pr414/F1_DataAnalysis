## F1_DataAnalysis
This project aims at building and querying on a documental database handling sportive
results. Having chosen Formula One as the sport of interest, the goal is to design and
implement queries capable of analyzing available data on races, drivers, and track perfor-
mances. MongoDB has been chosen as the database management system, allowing the
import of CSV-formatted data as Documental data and allowing various aggregation and
filtering operations to be performed in order to gather and analyze the data of interest.
